# AJ9BM's DX-SR8 Serial Interface

Back in 2013 AJ9BM did an analysis of the communication between the DX-SR8's chassis and its front panel. He found out a great deal about the protocol and built working prototypes but he eventually abandoned the project.

Before he did he released the python analysis code that's in my /aj9bm_code directory [on Github](https://github.com/jbm9/dxsr8_serial).

He also posted three videos about the project on YouTube. Videos [showing the analysis code running](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRo2k7FbKFA), [a prototype board controlling the rig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eBNIf6Rozc), and [one of a more finished prototype board controlling the rig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqtLbdCvwj8).

Unfortunately at that point he abandoned the project and never released the board design or the final code.

He added this to the captions on his videos:

> "UPDATE: I did not produce these for sale, and don't anticipate doing so.  There are enough kludges involved in getting this going that it's not worth sharing the project to other people, and (to be blunt) I would strongly recommend simply buying a better rig if you want to do computer control.  This is a great cheap 100W radio, but it's fairly dead-end in terms of third party support.  It doesn't even work properly with the autotuner you see in the video, for whatever reason."
